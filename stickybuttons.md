## Analytics Tagging

- The default tagging will be already coded.

## Gulpfile

Create task to fill and/or replace the following values:

- Share by email: URL and Subject.

## Resarch

- Research competition, how do they share content?
- Research techniques, for mobile and desktop.
- Research JS libraries, review with MSFT for approval.
- Research Analitics, do we need the "Share by email" button?

## Development

- Add methods/envets to turn on and off the sticky buttons for websites without scrollbar and/or on-demand.
- Review settings to show and/or hide the buttons.
